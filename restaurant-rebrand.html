			<p>For this project, I was tasked with redesigning an existing brand: El Capitan's Gourmet Sausages and Pretzels. While El Capitan's original branding was playful and had it's own character, I felt that a new spin on their branding would achieve their business goal in a more unique and fun way. I created a distinct mascot for their brand, leaning away from the obvious pirate imagery associated with their original branding while remaining loyal to the nautical themes. In the end, I created several assets for their rebranding such as logo variations, packaging mockups, a pattern, and stickers.</p>

		<div class="body">	
			<p>I began my process with a moodboard which helped me define my visual style and inspirations: Pirate’s picnic carries an energetic and bold style. It’s concept revolves around brightening up the pirates theme with a retro style that incorporates visual puns and heavy lineart. The relaxed atmosphere of El Capitan’s will be highlighted with this concept, pushing it’s character to new heights.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="body">	
			<p>Following my moodboard, I did a number of sketches to brainstorm logo ideas and add my own touch to the brand. While I did consider a number of different directions, I ultimately settled on the fishdog. After sketching, I transferred my physical work into Adobe Illustrator where I refined the fishdog numerous times in order to create what you see above in the final deliverables.</p>
